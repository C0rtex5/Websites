## Year 1: The Front end basics (And a little bit of backend)

<p>
The first year was dedicated to establishing a solid foundation in programming fundamentals, understanding the basics of binaries, Front-end development, website building, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
And also in the long run, being able to understand the basics of C++, C, python, hardware, SCRUM, and a few more.

## Year 2: Improving the networking, developing, programing and using AI for coding, and frist work experience exposure.

 <p>
During my second year in Programming and Computer Science, I realized that a huge challenge was on the horizon: the internship. It was a period of deepening and expanding my technical skills, especially in networking, software development, advanced programming, and the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in coding. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to dive into the professional world, gaining my first work experience in the field. My Achilles' heel was my lack of personal planning and soft skills.
But I wasn't falling for ruin, instead, for improvement and greatness.
